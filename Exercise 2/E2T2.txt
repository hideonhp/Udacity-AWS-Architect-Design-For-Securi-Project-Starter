Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1.	An IAM policy grants unrestricted access to resources.
2.	The load balancer lacks HTTP to HTTPS redirection.
3.	The default security group for the VPC permits unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic, contrary to AWS guidelines.
4.	The EC2 instance exposes TCP port 5000 to the internet.
5.	S3 buckets lack server-side encryption and logging capabilities.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1.	Establish IAM policies to disallow root user access and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), alongside granting specific permissions.
2.	Configure the Application Load Balancer to automatically redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
3.	Restrict traffic on the Security Groups to solely permit ports 80 and 443.
4.	Deactivate all non-essential ports on the EC2 instance.
5.	Activate server-side encryption and logging for the S3 bucket.
